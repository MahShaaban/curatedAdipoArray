#' A Curated Microarrays Dataset of MDI-induced Differentiated Adipocytes
#' (3T3-L1) Under Genetic and Pharmacological Perturbations
#'
#' A curated dataset of Microarrays samples. The samples are MDI-induced
#' pre-adipocytes (3T3-L1) at different time points/stage of differentiation
#' under different types of genetic (knockdown/overexpression) and
#' pharmacological (drug treatment). The package document the data collection
#' and processing. In addition to the documentation, the package contains the
